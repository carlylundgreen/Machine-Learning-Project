# Machine-Learning-Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Final Project.ipynb`) that aims to predict damages caused by flash flooding in the state of Utah. The file includes explanations and comments about the included code. 

The data comes from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and is accessible through NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). I aggregated a list of csv files that I accessed through the NCEI at the following URL: https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/legacy/.Â I chose to analyze floods in Utah from 2007 to 2013 for simplicity. 

As a method of exploring the data, the two image files included in the repository are maps of the locations of the floods between 2007 and 2013.
